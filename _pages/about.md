Hi! I am Gabriel Pensamiento, a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Business Analytics and Operations at the [University of Pittsburgh Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business](https://business.pitt.edu/), under the advice of Professor [León Valdés](https://www.leonvaldes.com/). I am currently in the 2024-2025 academic job market and expect to graduate by June 2025. 

In my research, I conduct controlled experiments combining game-theoretic and behavioral perspectives to promote socially responsible business practices. In particular, my research focuses on **Socially Responsible** and **Behavioral Operations**  topics, exploring how auditing and training improve supplier practices and how volunteers’ first experiences shape their continuation at non-profits. 

Before moving to Pittsburgh to start my PhD, I studied Industrial Engineering at Universidad del Istmo in Guatemala City. After that, I began my academic career at [IPADE Business School](https://www.ipadebusinessschool.com/) in Mexico City. I believe in the importance of international collaborations and near-shoring and look forward to bridging research between the US and Latin America throughout my academic career.

In my free time, I enjoy board games (ranging from family-friendly Catan to more complex GMT games), reading (mostly science fiction, high fantasy, or historical novels), and walking outdoors (from a relaxed Pokemon Go hunt with my wife to hiking in the area with friends).
